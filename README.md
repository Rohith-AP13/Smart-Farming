# Smart-Farming: AI-Powered Agricultural Assistant

This is a web application built with Next.js that serves as an intelligent assistant for farmers. It leverages the power of Generative AI to provide data-driven recommendations for crop selection and fertilizer usage, helping to increase yield and promote sustainable farming practices.

## Key Features

- **Secure User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in to a personal dashboard using Firebase Authentication.
- **AI Crop Recommendations**: Input soil data (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium levels) and local climate conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.) to receive a list of suitable crops generated by an AI model.
- **AI Fertilizer Suggestions**: Based on the recommended crops and soil data, the application provides tailored suggestions for the optimal type and amount of fertilizer.
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: A live chart displays the soil's primary nutrient balance, which updates in real-time as you adjust the values. This data is shared across all relevant pages.
- **Multi-Page Dashboard**: A clean, modern interface with a sidebar for easy navigation between the dashboard, crop recommendation, fertilizer suggestion, and nutrient chart pages.
- **Protected Routes**: Middleware ensures that all application pages are protected and only accessible to authenticated users.

## How to Use the Application

1.  **Sign Up / Login**: Create a new account or log in with existing credentials to access the dashboard.
2.  **Navigate to Crop Recommendation**: Use the sidebar to go to the "Crop Recommendation" page.
3.  **Input Your Data**: Use the sliders to enter your farm's soil and climate data. Click the "Get Crop Recommendation" button. The AI will analyze the data and suggest suitable crops.
4.  **Get Fertilizer Advice**: Go to the "Fertilizer Suggestion" page. The soil data from the previous step will be pre-filled. Select one of the newly recommended crops from the dropdown menu and click "Get Fertilizer Suggestion".
5.  **Visualize Nutrients**: You can visit the "Nutrient Chart" page at any time to see a visualization of your current soil data or to adjust the values, which will then be reflected on the other pages.
