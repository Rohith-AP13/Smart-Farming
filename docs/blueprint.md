# **App Name**: AgriAssist

## Core Features:

- Soil Data Input: Allow farmers to input soil features (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium levels, pH, moisture) and environmental parameters (temperature, rainfall, humidity) via a user-friendly form.
- Crop Recommendation Engine: Leverage a pre-trained machine learning model via API to suggest suitable crops for cultivation based on the input soil and environmental conditions.
- Fertilizer Suggestion Tool: Based on soil nutrient levels and selected crop type, an AI tool suggests the required type and amount of fertilizer (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium-based) to balance soil nutrients using a pre-trained machine learning model accessed via API.
- Recommendation Display: Clearly display the recommended crop(s) and fertilizer suggestions with key data points on an easy-to-understand dashboard.
- Data Visualization: Show charts to visualize soil nutrient balance, like bar graphs indicating Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium, past conditions, etc.
- Historical Data Tracking: Record the inputs made to the system to produce the basis of historical reports on the farm's activities and its changes over time.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy green (#6B8E23) to evoke nature and growth.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC) to provide a neutral and clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Burnt orange (#CC6633) for highlighting important information and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern, yet approachable feel.
- Use clear, simple icons representing soil nutrients, weather conditions, and crop types.
- Implement a clean, grid-based layout for easy navigation and data presentation.
- Subtle transitions and animations for data updates and recommendations to provide a smooth user experience.
